# Car Physics Configuration
# All values are tunable - experiment to find what feels right!

# Default values used as fallback for all car types
defaults:
  turning:
    # TORQUE: How much rotational force is applied when turning left/right
    # - Higher = sharper, more responsive turns
    # - Lower = sluggish, wide turns (like a truck)
    # - Too high = car spins out easily, feels twitchy
    torque: 10.0  # N·m

    # ANGULAR FRICTION: Reduces unwanted spinning/rotation
    # - Higher = car stops spinning faster, more stable
    # - Lower = car continues spinning, feels slippery
    # - Helps prevent uncontrolled rotation after turning
    angular_friction: 0.5

    # ANGULAR DAMPING: General resistance to all rotation over time
    # - Higher = rotation slows down faster (more stable)
    # - Lower = car keeps rotating longer (drifty feel)
    # - Works passively even when not turning
    angular_damping: 10.0  # 1/sec

  movement:
    # MAX SPEED: Top speed the car can reach
    # - Higher = faster car (but harder to control)
    # - Lower = slower car (easier to control)
    # - Measured in pixels/second
    max_speed: 500.0  # px/s

    # MAX ACCELERATION: How quickly the car reaches max speed
    # - Higher = faster acceleration, more responsive
    # - Lower = slower acceleration, feels heavy/sluggish
    # - Affects both speeding up and slowing down
    max_acceleration: 300.0  # px/s²

    # BACKWARD SPEED MULTIPLIER: Reverse speed as fraction of forward speed
    # - 0.5 = reverse is half as fast as forward
    # - Higher = faster reverse
    # - Lower = slower reverse
    backward_speed_multiplier: 0.5

    # SPEED CONTROLLER GAIN: How aggressively the car tries to reach target speed
    # - Higher = reaches desired speed faster (more responsive gas/brake)
    # - Lower = gradual speed changes (feels floaty)
    # - Too high can cause oscillation/jerky movement
    speed_controller_gain: 30.0

  friction:
    # MAX LATERAL IMPULSE: Maximum sideways grip force
    # - Higher = less drifting, car "sticks" to its direction
    # - Lower = MORE drifting, slides sideways easily
    # - Controls how much the car can slide laterally
    max_lateral_impulse: 8.0  # N·s

    # FORWARD DRAG COEFFICIENT: Air/rolling resistance against forward motion
    # - More negative = stronger drag, car slows faster when not accelerating
    # - Less negative = car coasts longer, feels slippery
    # - Affects how quickly car decelerates when letting go of gas
    forward_drag_coefficient: -0.5  # N/(m/s)

    # LINEAR DAMPING: General resistance to all linear motion
    # - Higher = car slows down faster overall
    # - Lower = car maintains velocity longer (ice-like)
    # - Applied constantly to all movement
    linear_damping: 1.0  # 1/sec

  body:
    # DENSITY: Mass per unit area (affects total weight)
    # - Higher = heavier car, harder to push around in collisions
    # - Lower = lighter car, gets pushed easily
    # - Also affects how much force is needed to accelerate
    density: 1.0  # kg/m²

    # FRICTION: Surface friction during collisions/contact
    # - Higher = more grip when scraping walls/other cars
    # - Lower = slides along surfaces easier
    # - Only affects collisions, not driving
    friction: 0.3  # 0.0-1.0

    # RESTITUTION: Bounciness in collisions
    # - 0.0 = no bounce (absorbs impact)
    # - 1.0 = perfect bounce (like a rubber ball)
    # - 0.1-0.3 is typical for cars
    restitution: 0.3 

    # WIDTH/HEIGHT: Physical collision box size
    # - Should match sprite dimensions
    # - Measured in pixels
    width: 22.0   # pixels
    height: 28.0  # pixels

# Specific car type configurations
# Each car inherits from defaults and can override specific values
